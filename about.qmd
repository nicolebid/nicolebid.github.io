Hi! I'm Nicole, a Data Science Specialist with a rewarding career in Education. Obtaining a Master of Data Science from the University of British Columbia, 
and a Bachelor of Science in Mathematics from Simon Fraser University, has built my foundation in data analysis, machine learning and statistical modeling.
Working in Education&mdash;including roles as a Senior Mathematics Educator and Guidance Counselor&mdash;has refined my problem-solving skills and ability to 
communicate complex topics to diverse audiences. I now apply these skills in data science to uncover insights and facilitate data-driven decisions. 

Beyond my professional pursuits, youâ€™ll find me immersed in activities like hockey, hiking, travel, and promoting mental well-being. This website serves as a platform 
to share my projects and passions, offering a glimpse into how my unique experiences and interests shape my approach to data science.
