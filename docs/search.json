    "text": "Hi! I’m Nicole, a data science enthusiast coming from a rewarding background as a mathematics educator. With a Master of Data Science from the University of British Columbia, and a bachelor’s degree in mathematics from Simon Fraser University, I’ve gained a solid foundation in data analysis, machine learning and statistical modeling. My experience as an educator has refined my problem-solving skills and ability to communicate complex topics to diverse audiences dash—skills I now apply in data science to uncover insights and drive data-driven decisions.\nBeyond my professional pursuits, you’ll find me immersed in activities like hockey, hiking, travel, and promoting mental well-being. As a coach on the ice, a fitness enthusiast in the gym, and a curious traveler, I believe in the power of holistic well-being for personal and professional growth. This website serves as a platform to share my projects and passions, offering a glimpse into how my unique experiences and interests shape my approach to data science."
